  <h3>Some nifty recent work I did in my free time</h3>

  <p>
    <a name="snapchat-fs"></a>
    <em>Snapchat FS</em> <br/>

    I reverse engineered Snapchat's private API. Snapchat FS is a client I wrote (with some help from <%= link_to '@pencilo', 'https://github.com/pencilo' %> ) that allows you to use Snapchat to store and manage arbitrary files.

    <a name="turtles"></a>
    <em>Turtles: turns the Apple //e into a lisp machine</em> <br/>

    Wrote code to send the assembled lisp interpreter binary from a laptop through the audio jack, to the Apple //e, which then stores the lisp and opens up a REPL.

  </p>

  <p>
    <a name="pyli"></a>
    <em>pyli -- Python 3 compiler in < 4000 lines of code</em> <br/>

    Writing parsers and lexers is really hard. I wondered if I could write a parser for almost all of Python that anyone could understand. As soon as I finish the AST-to-bytecode step, this will be a complete compiler, but for now it's "only" a parser and lexer.

    <em>Completely transition all state serialization in Storm (Twitter's stream processing system) from the Java stock serializer to a type-annotated JSON</em> <br/>

    <%= link_to 'Storm', 'https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/' %> is a stream processing system from Backtype (acquired by Twitter).

    Storm used to use Java's stock serialization capabilities to persist system state (useful, <i>e.g.</i>, for checkpointing and reliability purposes).

    This patch completely replaces stock Java serialization with a type-annotated JSON called EDN.

    This solves issues <%= link_to '#419', 'https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/issues/419' %> and <%= link_to '#525', 'https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/issues/525' %>, and supersedes pull request <%= link_to '#497', 'https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/pull/497' %>.
