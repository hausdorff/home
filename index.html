  <h1>#HACK</h1>
  <h3>Some nifty recent work I did in my free time</h3>

  <p>
    <a name="snapchat-fs"></a>
    <em>Snapchat FS</em> &#8212;
    [<a href="https://github.com/hausdorff/snapchat-fs" target="snapchatfs">code</a>]
    <br/>

    I reverse engineered Snapchat's private API. Snapchat FS is a client I wrote (with some help from <a href="https://github.com/pencilo" target="pencilo">@pencilo</a>) that allows you to use Snapchat to store and manage arbitrary files.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a name="turtles"></a>
    <em>Turtles: turns Apple //e -> lisp machine</em> &#8212;
    [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tey9sFqICSk" target="turtles-video">video</a>,
    <a href="http://blog.nullspace.io/apple-2-lisp-part-1.html" target="turtles-writeup">writeup</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/hausdorff/turtles" target="turtles-code">code</a>]

    <br/>

    Wrote code to send the assembled lisp interpreter binary from a laptop through the audio jack, to the Apple //e, which then stores the lisp and opens up a REPL.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a name="pyli"></a>
    <em>pyli&#8212;Python 3 compiler in &lt; 4000 lines of code</em> &#8212;
    [<a href="http://blog.nullspace.io/obvious-python-parser.html" target="pyli-writeup">writeup</a>,
    <a href="http://github.com/hausdorff/pyli/blob/master/src/Parser.hs" target="pyli-code">code</a>]
   <br/>

    Writing parsers and lexers is really hard. I wondered if I could write a parser for almost all of Python that anyone could understand. As soon as I finish the AST-to-bytecode step, this will be a complete compiler, but for now it's "only" a parser and lexer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Adding Haskell's <tt>where</tt> clause to OCaml</em> &#8212;
    [<a href="http://blog.nullspace.io/adding-haskells-where-to-ocaml.html" target="where-writeup">writeup</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/hausdorff/ocaml-where" target="where-code">code</a>]
   <br/>

    I love Haskell's <tt>where</tt> clause. It is one of the features I really missed when I started learning OCaml, and eventually it got so bad, I ended up just extending OCaml syntax to support it.

    <br/>

    More than 40% of our 27 speakers were women, and all speakers were chosen by a blind program committee. More than a third of attendees were women. Our entire ticket stock sold out in under 15 seconds. We obtained more than $15k in sponsorships. The talks were all amazing.
